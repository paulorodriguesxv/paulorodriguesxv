### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm really enthusiastic and extremelly passionate about technology, research and innovation. I'm interested in software development technologies such as Python, React Native, Microservices, Software Architecture, SOA, .Net Core, AWS, Machine Learning, etc.
Working as a developer over 15 years, I'm skilled in software architecture, Python, Delphi and some others topics, like microservices concepts.
In 2018 I was a top 3 winners of the Codenation Data Science Brazil challenge, subsequently participating in a hackathon in the New York city promoted by Codenation and Loadsmart
